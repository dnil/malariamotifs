Dear user, 

I don't like to apologize about code; it is always produced under
constraints of time (read urgency of publishing the data) and skill,
but this was an unusually evolutionary project and written way back
when. I guess it's a sign of progress that I at least now know many,
many ways to make this better now. Actually probably already could
think of many back then, but time in PhD sideprojects is a complicated
resource to manage. If someone could get me a couple of weeks off
other projects I could get this up to a distributable shape.

That aside, this is how it looked when we used it, so it is actually
possible. I hope it will be of some use to you too!

This package has been ported successfully to a handful of different
systems, and at least once by someone other than me, but I
unfortunately have to advise you to expect it to be quite a bit of
detective work.

There used to be a website with a current version of the MOTIFF stuff on it, 

http://cruzi.cgb.ki.se/daniel/motiffinder.php

but it appears to be down nowadays.

If you take the time to set this up on your machine, I'd be grateful
for a note saying so (I'm currently at daniel.nilsson@izb.unibe.ch),
and, for publications using it, for a reference to the first publication
(Normark et al, PNAS 2007, PMID: 1789539).

Basically there are two paths to take: start with seqeuncing raw data,
	  and go all the way to motifs etc - then see
	  process_reads.sh (comments in FROM RAW DATA below).

or start with a (conceptual) peptide sequence alignment and phenotype
	  information file to produce motifs: see
	  section_alingment_v2.pl and rescore_section_file_using_R.pl

There are quite a few handy perl programs in here. Some of the perl
programs will produce terse usage instructions if invoked without
parameters. A quick browse some that still not were quite complete yet
when I left the building are also included.

If you are interested, I also started implementing a
web-server-version at one point, but this was also left
incomplete. While it doesn't add anything to the functionality, the
wrapping might be useful (see mosphet).

FROM RAW DATA

process_reads.sh read_file_name task [matrix]

task, the second parameter, is one of 

     all        -  all of the below
     most	  -  most of the below :-)
     phred      -  basecall reads (requires phred, www.phrap.org)
     trim       -  quality trim (requires EMBOSS, www.emboss.org)
     phrap      -  assembly/clustering (requires phrap, www.phrap.org)
     translate  -  conceptual translation (requires EMBOSS)
     realign    -  realigner (requires realigner, binary shipped else enquire from bjorn.andersson@ki.se)
                   (also translates realigned reads, req. EMBOSS)
     flip       -  reorient nucleotide sequences based on best peptide trans using known motifs and top codon count (req EMBOSS)
     blast      -  attempt to annotate and recognise known sequences (req NCBI blast and a formatted database, preferenially from the gene of interest)    
                   also instrumental in filtering out possible contaminants and spearately treating e.g. possible known untranslated/unexported genes.
     tree       -  tree construction (req clustal, www.clustal.org)
     motifs     -  (req R, www.r-project.org and NCBI blast, EMBOSS for PSSM-export and finding those motifs in other sequences) 
                   Also run section_alignment w/o options for usage. See also section alignment v2 and rescore using R for more details.
     cleanup    -  attempts to clean up temporary files etc, but as the concept of temporary is somewhat depending on the task at hand, this is rather permissive.

Several of the perl programs called also depend on bioperl.

The aa-similarity matrix, optional third argument, can be either blosum or gonnet.

There are also a couple of other tasks, lmo and stats, that are
helpful for development etc. These can also be instructive for how to
classify the found motifs in new sequences etc.

The required binaries are assumed to be on the PATH, so please set it
accordingly.

An environment variable (or a few if you use a different catalog
structure from the original) at the top of the script need to point to
where your data and these scripts are located.

FROM ALN FILE (AND PHENOTYPE/DOMINANCE TABLE)

Alignment file in clustal aln format. Phenotype/dominance table with a
tab separated list of sequences and "isolate names".  The latter can
well substituted for any dichtomy of the sequences, setting one class
as se00 (from severe disease) and the other as co00 (from control
set). See the data dir for a couple of examples.

sequence_name	isolate_name

USAGE: section_alignment.v2.pl	<--in clustalw.aln>
				[--dominancetab|-t dominance_table]
				[--countmodel oneperisolate]		count one dominant per isolate
	   			[--ultraconserved f ] 0<f<1 0.82
  				[--conserved f ] 0<f<1 0.4
				[--strictsection|-s] Strict section 0

And for a correction to the hypergeometric probs:

USAGE: rescore_section_file_using_R.pl		     <--in section>
				[--countmodel oneperisolate]		count one dominant per isolate
				[--motifs_only]   Retain only the motif summary
